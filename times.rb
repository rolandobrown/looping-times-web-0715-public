# 1. Fork and clone this lab.
# 2. Run the test suite with the `learn` command. 
# 3. You'll be coding your solution in `times.rb`: 
# 4. Fill out the content of the `using_times` method so that 
# calling it will `puts` the desired phrase, `"Wingardium Leviosa"` 
# seven times by using the `times` keyword.
